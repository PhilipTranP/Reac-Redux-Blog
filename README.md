This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project is part of the requirement for a React Nano Degree Program.<br>
 [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The second part of the program students work on a project called Readable. The goal is to learn the core concept of Redux.

For the Readable project, students build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

Basic APIs is provided. For a glance of the API and how it works, you can see the link:<br>

I have spent some times to style it using Tachyons.io just to make it not a sore in the eyes for whoever happens to find and check out this project.

I tested out a Redux pattern of making a separate reducer for a unique shape of data so newbies (like me) wont have to struggle with sophisticated reduce functions. I found it save my time in glancing through the UI and track the data logic if I follow this pattern.
